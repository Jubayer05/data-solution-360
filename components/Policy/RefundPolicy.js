        <li>
          If you are unsatisfied with the course content or quality, you may
          request a refund within <strong>7 days (1 week)</strong> of the
          starting date.
        </li>

          If you accidentally purchased the same course more than once, we will
          refund the duplicate purchase(s) upon notification.
        </li>

          If there is a technical issue or error that prevents you from
          accessing or using the course materials, and we are unable to resolve
          the issue within a reasonable time frame, you may be eligible for a
          refund.

      </ul>

      <p className="text-base mt-4">
        Please note that refund eligibility may vary for special promotions,

        eligibility criteria will be clearly stated at the time of purchase. To
